# Lab 12

Activities:

1. Pick up your name tag

2. Share with your group, *what is your favorite Python module, and why?*  It could be something we use in 320, or something you learned elsewhere.

3. Debugging Practice: inside your `cs320-s23-projects` repo, there is a [`labs/debug/8-geo/main.ipynb`](./debug/8-geo/main.ipynb).  Try to fix the bugs.  There is a `solution.ipynb` too, but only peek as a last resort!

4. Use a LinearRegression to [predict how long](./regression) it will take to run a piece of code

5. Return your name tag
